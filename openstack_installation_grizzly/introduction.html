<a name="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<p>OpenStack has come a long way from a very basic cloud orchestration platform to a distributed
set of services which are tied together and work together using a messaging layer. This distributed
nature of architecture also makes it hard to install and configure OpenStack.</p>

<p> Aim of this book is to explain in detail steps to be followed to install all the basic components
of <code>OpenStack, Grizzly</code></p>
